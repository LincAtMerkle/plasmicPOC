# plasmicPOC

This is a repo that merges two projects:

1. How to Create a Plasmic Package ( React | Code Components | TSDX | Chakra UI) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzpfG3c1wYY

2. FigmaTokens Chakra POC (using Framer) 
https://github.com/esthercheran/chakraPOC

The idea is to swap out Framer with Plasmic and see if it performs better.
