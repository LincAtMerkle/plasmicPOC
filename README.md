# plasmicPOC

This is a repo that merges two projects:

1. How to Create a Plasmic Package ( React | Code Components | TSDX | Chakra UI)

2. FigmaTokens Chakra POC (using Framer) 
https://github.com/esthercheran/chakraPOC
We did a live stream on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7St9GZlJH4k 

The idea is to swap out Framer with Plasmic and see if it performs better.
